# âš½ Euro 2024 Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning-based prediction model built to forecast match outcomes of the UEFA Euro 2024 football tournament. It uses historical match data and a Poisson regression model to predict the number of goals each team is likely to score and progress further in the tournament.

## ðŸš€ Project Motivation

As a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about Artificial Intelligence, I developed this project to apply foundational AI and data science techniques in a real-world sports context. This was my first AI-based project, and I took the initiative to learn key tools and concepts to build it from scratch.

## ðŸ“Š Data Collection

- **Historical Data**: Extracted manually using Beautiful Soap from Wikipedia
- **Euro 2024 Fixtures**: Gathered manually and saved in CSV format for prediction.

---

## ðŸ§® Model Approach

- Cleaned and engineered features like goals, home/away teams,Attack Strengths, Defence Strengths and year.
- Trained a **Poisson Regression model** using historical goal-scoring patterns.
- Predicted the expected number of goals each team would score in a given fixture.
- Used those predictions to simulate match results.
